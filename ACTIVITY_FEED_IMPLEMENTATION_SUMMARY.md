# Activity Feed Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Assistant Pane redesign, transforming it from a proposal-only queue into a unified activity feed supporting proposals, insights, and Q&A interactions.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Migration ✅
**File:** `docs/architecture/ACTIVITY_FEED_MIGRATION.sql`

- Added `activity_type` column to proposals table ('proposal', 'insight', 'question', 'answer')
- Added `parent_id` column for linking Q&A (answers link to questions)
- Made several existing columns nullable (proposal_type, component_type, confidence, changes)
- Added indexes for performance
- Created helper functions:
  - `create_question()` - Save user questions
  - `create_answer()` - Save AI answers linked to questions  
  - `create_insight()` - Save non-actionable insights
- Added check constraints to ensure data integrity

### 2. TypeScript Types ✅
**File:** `frontend/src/types/database.types.ts`

- Added `ActivityType` export type
- Updated `proposals` table types to include new fields
- Made proposal-specific fields nullable
- Extended `ProposalWithDetails` interface with:
  - Optional `parsedChanges` (only for proposals)
  - `question` and `answer` fields for Q&A linking

### 3. ActivityCard Component ✅
**File:** `frontend/src/components/ai/ActivityCard.tsx`

Created a unified card component that renders different layouts based on `activity_type`:

**Proposal Cards:**
- Type badge, confidence dots
- Current vs proposed values
- Rationale, evidence
- Apply/Modify/Reject/Defer buttons
- Identical to original ProposalCard functionality

**Insight Cards:**
- Lightbulb icon, yellow accent
- Title and description
- Evidence section
- Simple "Got it" button to dismiss
- No defer option (not actionable)

**Question Cards:**
- User avatar, blue chat bubble
- Question text
- Timestamp

**Answer Cards:**
- AI avatar (gradient purple/pink with sparkles icon)
- Answer text
- Expandable sources/evidence
- Timestamp

### 4. ActivityFeed Component ✅
**File:** `frontend/src/components/ai/ActivityFeed.tsx`

Replaced ProposalQueue with a unified activity feed:

- Filters for activity type (all, proposals, insights, Q&A)
- Status filter (for proposals/insights only, not Q&A)
- Stats badges showing pending counts
- Chronological display (newest first)
- Empty states and loading skeletons

### 5. AssistantPane Component ✅
**File:** `frontend/src/components/ai/AssistantPane.tsx`

Updated the main pane component:

- Renamed tab from "Proposals" to "Activity"
- Uses ActivityFeed instead of ProposalQueue
- Added tabs for Activity and Settings
- Wired up chat input to save questions to database
- Disabled chat when no project selected
- Shows pending count badge on Activity tab

**handleSendMessage():**
- Creates question in database with `activity_type: 'question'`
- Clears input after sending
- TODO comment for future AI service integration

### 6. useProposals Hook ✅
**File:** `frontend/src/hooks/useProposals.ts`

Extended to support all activity types:

- Fetches all activities (proposals, insights, Q&A)
- Parses `changes` only for proposals (not insights/Q&A)
- Updated pending count to exclude answers (auto-accepted)
- Fixed type issues with Supabase client (using @ts-ignore for now)

### 7. ProjectOverview Archive ✅
**File:** `frontend/src/components/views/ProjectOverview.tsx`

Added deferred proposals archive section:

- Appears at top of overview (after project header, before stats)
- Shows count badge
- Collapsible with chevron icon
- Displays deferred proposals using ActivityCard
- Only visible when deferred proposals exist
- Users can accept, reject, or defer again from archive

### 8. AI Service Updates ✅
**Files:** `ai-service/models.py`, `ai-service/services/*.py`

Updated Python backend to support activity types:

**Models:**
- Added `ActivityType` enum (proposal, insight, question, answer)
- Updated `AIProposal` model with `activity_type` field
- Made proposal-specific fields optional
- Added `QuestionAnswerRequest` and `QuestionAnswerResponse` models

**Services:**
- Added `answer_question()` method to base service
- Implemented Q&A for OpenAI service
- Implemented Q&A for Anthropic service
- Updated system prompts to distinguish proposals vs insights

See `AI_SERVICE_UPDATES.md` for detailed documentation.

## How It Works

### User Asks Question
1. User types question in chat input at bottom of Assistant Pane
2. Question saved to database as `activity_type: 'question'`, `status: 'pending'`
3. Appears immediately in activity feed as blue chat bubble
4. (Future) AI service generates answer, saves as `activity_type: 'answer'` with `parent_id` linking to question
5. Answer appears below question with AI avatar

### AI Generates Insight
1. AI analyzes project/task
2. Saves to database as `activity_type: 'insight'`, `status: 'pending'`
3. Appears in feed with yellow accent, lightbulb icon
4. User can click "Got it" to dismiss (status changes to 'accepted')
5. No defer option - insights are informational only

### AI Generates Proposal
1. AI analyzes project/task
2. Saves to database as `activity_type: 'proposal'` with all existing fields
3. Appears in feed with full functionality (Apply/Modify/Reject/Defer)
4. If deferred, moves to archive in Project Overview
5. User can restore from archive by accepting or re-deferring

### Activity Feed Filters
- **Activity Type:** All, Proposals, Insights, Q&A
- **Status:** Pending, Accepted, Rejected, Deferred
- Q&A shows both questions and answers regardless of status
- Stats badges update in real-time

## Next Steps

### 1. Apply Database Migration
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor:
1. Copy contents of docs/architecture/ACTIVITY_FEED_MIGRATION.sql
2. Paste into SQL Editor
3. Run the migration
4. Verify columns were added successfully
```

### 2. Regenerate TypeScript Types
```bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > frontend/src/types/database.types.ts
```

This will resolve the TypeScript errors in useProposals.ts.

### 3. AI Service Integration (Future)
- Implement answer generation in AI service (FastAPI)
- Create endpoint: `POST /api/ai/answer`
- Update handleSendMessage() in AssistantPane to call AI service
- Save answer with `parent_id` pointing to question

### 4. Insight Generation (Future)
- Implement insight detection in AI validation
- Add logic to determine when to generate insights vs proposals
- Use `create_insight()` function from migration

### 5. Archive Enhancements (Future)
- Add search/filter to archive
- Bulk accept/reject from archive
- Archive expiration (auto-delete old deferred items)

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Apply database migration successfully
- [ ] Regenerate TypeScript types
- [ ] Open Project Assistant pane
- [ ] Verify Activity tab displays
- [ ] Type and send a question
- [ ] Verify question appears in feed
- [ ] Defer a proposal
- [ ] Navigate to Overview
- [ ] Verify deferred proposal appears in archive
- [ ] Accept proposal from archive
- [ ] Verify it disappears from archive
- [ ] Filter activity by type
- [ ] Filter activity by status
- [ ] Collapse/expand archive section

### AI Service Testing (After Integration)
- [ ] Send question, verify answer appears
- [ ] Verify answer links to correct question
- [ ] Verify answer evidence displays properly
- [ ] Generate insight, verify it appears with yellow accent
- [ ] Dismiss insight, verify status updates

## Known Issues

1. **TypeScript Errors in useProposals.ts:** Will be resolved after applying migration and regenerating types
2. **No AI Answer Generation:** Requires AI service integration (documented in TODO comments)
3. **ProposalQueue/ProposalCard Still Exist:** Old components not deleted yet (safe to remove after testing)

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Unified Feed?
- User requested all activities in chronological order
- Reduces risk of missing important proposals
- Natural conversation flow for Q&A
- Simpler UX - one place to look

### Why Not Separate Tabs?
- User specifically wanted to avoid missing proposals in different tabs
- Q&A and proposals are related - often questions lead to proposals
- Insights provide context for proposals

### Why Archive in Overview?
- User requested deferred items visible but not prominent
- Overview is natural place for project-level information
- Keeps Assistant Pane focused on active work
- Collapsible to reduce clutter

## Performance Considerations

- Activity feed pagination not implemented (not needed for MVP)
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscription (already implemented in useProposals)
- Indexes added for activity_type and parent_id queries
- Partial index for parent_id (only when not null)

## Security

- All RLS policies remain unchanged
- Users only see activities for their own projects
- Chat input disabled when no project selected
- No new security concerns introduced
