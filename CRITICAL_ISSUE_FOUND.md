# Critical Issue: Supabase Read Queries Hanging Indefinitely

## Problem
The `fetchProjects` query is hanging indefinitely (30+ seconds) even though:
- ✅ Supabase credentials are configured correctly
- ✅ User authentication works (logged in as pauloster79@gmail.com)
- ✅ Projects exist in the database (confirmed by user)
- ❌ The query never completes

## Root Cause Analysis

### What's Happening
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('projects')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
```

This query hangs indefinitely and never returns data or an error.

### Possible Causes

1. **Row Level Security (RLS) Policy Issue**
   - RLS policies might be misconfigured
   - Query might be waiting for permission check that never completes
   - User might not have SELECT permission on `projects` table

2. **Network/Connection Issue**
   - Slow network to Supabase servers
   - Connection established but data transfer stalled
   - Supabase project might be paused/sleeping

3. **Database Index Missing**
   - Query on `user_id` without index
   - Full table scan timing out

4. **Supabase Project Status**
   - Project might be in maintenance mode
   - Free tier limits reached
   - Database needs to be woken up

## Immediate Fix Needed

### Check RLS Policies

Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Policies → projects table

**Required SELECT policy:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own projects"
ON projects FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Check Database Status

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Check if project is active (not paused)
3. Check database logs for errors

### Alternative Approach

Since AUTH works but reads don't, test if WRITES work:
- Try creating a new project
- If create works but read doesn't → RLS SELECT policy issue
- If neither work → broader connection issue

## Temporary Workarounds

### Option 1: Bypass RLS for Testing
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor (TEMPORARY - NOT FOR PRODUCTION)
ALTER TABLE projects DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Option 2: Use Service Role Key
```typescript
// In lib/supabase.ts (NOT RECOMMENDED - SECURITY RISK)
const supabaseServiceRole = createClient(url, SERVICE_ROLE_KEY)
```

### Option 3: Direct SQL Query
```sql
-- Test in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT * FROM projects WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id-here';
```

## What to Do Next

1. **Check Supabase Dashboard**
   - Is project active?
   - Any error logs?
   - RLS policies configured?

2. **Test with SQL Editor**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM projects LIMIT 5;
   ```

3. **Check Network**
   - Open browser DevTools → Network tab
   - Look for failed/pending requests to Supabase

4. **Verify User ID**
   ```javascript
   console.log('User ID:', user.id)
   ```
   Make sure it matches user_id in projects table

## Current Status

- ❌ Fetch Projects: Hanging indefinitely
- ✅ Authentication: Working
- ❓ Create Project: Not tested yet
- ❓ Update Project: Not tested yet
- ❓ Delete Project: Not tested yet

## Recommendation

**The issue is almost certainly RLS policies.** Your Supabase database likely has Row Level Security enabled but no SELECT policy configured, causing all SELECT queries to hang waiting for permission.

**Quick Fix:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication → Policies
3. Add SELECT policy for projects table
4. Policy should allow: `auth.uid() = user_id`
