# Q&A Display Fix - Complete ✅

## Issue
User reported: "When I put a question in it does nothing"

## Root Cause
The Q&A functionality was working correctly:
- ✅ Question was sent to AI service
- ✅ AI service responded with status 200
- ✅ Answer was received by frontend

**BUT** the answer wasn't displaying because:
- ❌ Database (Supabase) isn't configured
- ❌ Q&A wasn't being saved to database
- ❌ Activity Feed only shows proposals from database
- ❌ No local state to display Q&As immediately

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Local State for Q&As
**File**: `frontend/src/components/ai/AssistantPane.tsx`

Added state to store Q&As locally:
```typescript
const [localQAs, setLocalQAs] = useState<Array<{question: string, answer: string, timestamp: string}>>([]);
```

### 2. Store Q&As Immediately After Response
When AI responds, immediately add to local state:
```typescript
setLocalQAs(prev => [...prev, {
  question: questionText,
  answer: data.answer,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
}]);
```

### 3. Pass Local Q&As to Activity Feed
```typescript
<ActivityFeed
  proposals={proposals}
  localQAs={localQAs}  // NEW
  ...
/>
```

### 4. Display Local Q&As in Activity Feed
**File**: `frontend/src/components/ai/ActivityFeed.tsx`

Added rendering for local Q&As:
- Questions appear in blue cards
- Answers appear in green cards
- Both show timestamps
- Displayed before database proposals

### 5. Added Loading Spinner
Send button now shows spinning icon while processing

### 6. Added Debug Logging
Console now shows:
- When handleSendMessage is called
- What question is being sent
- Response status
- Full answer received

## Result

Now when you ask a question:
1. ✅ Input clears immediately
2. ✅ Send button shows loading spinner
3. ✅ Question and answer appear instantly in Activity Feed
4. ✅ Works without database configuration
5. ✅ Will also work with database when configured

## Visual Design

**Question Card (Blue):**
- Blue background with border
- "Q" icon in blue circle
- Question text
- Timestamp

**Answer Card (Green):**
- Green background with border
- "A" icon in green circle
- Answer text
- Timestamp

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Refresh the frontend (hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Type a question in the chat input
3. Press Enter or click Send
4. You should immediately see:
   - Question in blue card
   - Answer in green card below it
