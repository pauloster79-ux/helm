# Q&A Functionality Implementation - Complete ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Q&A functionality that allows users to ask questions about their projects through the Project Assistant. The AI now has full visibility into all project data and can answer questions with minimal prompt guidance.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend Data Access (ai-service/services/database_service.py)
Added four new methods to fetch comprehensive project context:
- `get_project_details(project_id)` - Fetches project name, description, status, dates
- `get_project_tasks(project_id)` - Fetches all non-deleted tasks with full details
- `get_task_dependencies(project_id)` - Fetches all task dependencies
- `get_project_context(project_id)` - Combines all above data plus statistics:
  - Status breakdown (todo, in_progress, review, done counts)
  - Priority breakdown (low, medium, high counts)
  - Total estimated hours
  - Completion percentage
  - Total dependencies

### 2. API Models (ai-service/models.py)
Added request/response models:
- `QuestionRequest` - Simple model with project_id, question, and optional user_id
- `QuestionAnswerResponse` - Enhanced to include question_id, answer_id, and usage_stats

### 3. FastAPI Endpoint (ai-service/main.py)
Created `/answer-question` POST endpoint that:
1. Fetches comprehensive project context using database service
2. Formats all project data for AI consumption (project details, tasks, dependencies, statistics)
3. Gets AI configuration and calls appropriate AI service (OpenAI or Anthropic)
4. Saves question as a proposal record (activity_type='question')
5. Saves answer as a proposal record (activity_type='answer', parent_id=question_id)
6. Logs AI usage for cost tracking
7. Returns answer with evidence and metadata

### 4. NestJS Backend Proxy (backend/src/ai/)
Added endpoints in both controller and service:
- **Controller**: `@Post('answer-question')` route
- **Service**: `answerQuestion(projectId, question, userId)` method that proxies to FastAPI

### 5. Frontend Types (frontend/src/types/database.types.ts)
Added TypeScript interfaces:
- `QuestionRequest` - For frontend-to-backend requests
- `QuestionResponse` - For backend-to-frontend responses with all metadata

### 6. Frontend Integration (frontend/src/components/ai/AssistantPane.tsx)
Updated `handleSendMessage()` to:
- Call backend `/api/ai/answer-question` endpoint
- Clear input immediately for better UX
- Display loading state
- Refresh proposals feed to show new Q&A
- Handle errors gracefully
- Removed unused Supabase import

### 7. Display Components (frontend/src/components/ai/ActivityCard.tsx)
Already had support for Q&A display:
- `QuestionCard` - Shows user questions with blue styling
- `AnswerCard` - Shows AI answers with green styling and expandable evidence

## Project Context Provided to AI

The AI receives comprehensive context about the project:

**Project Details:**
- Name, description, status, creation dates

**All Tasks:**
- Title, description, status, priority
- Progress percentage, estimated hours
- Start date, end date, due date
- Parent task relationships, owner assignments

**Dependencies:**
- All task dependencies with types (finish_to_start, etc.)

**Statistics:**
- Total task count
- Status breakdown (how many in each status)
- Priority breakdown (how many at each priority)
- Completion percentage
- Total estimated hours
- Total dependencies

## Minimal Prompt Strategy

As requested, we kept the existing minimal prompts from the AI services:

**System Prompt:**
```
"You are a helpful project management assistant. 
Provide clear, actionable answers to user questions about their projects."
```

**User Prompt:**
Just the question text plus all the formatted project context data.

**No specific guidance** on:
- What to analyze
- What patterns to look for
- How to structure responses

This allows us to test the AI's natural capabilities to understand and respond to project management questions.

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. **Start the services:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - AI Service
   cd ai-service
   python start.py
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Select a project with multiple tasks**

3. **Ask questions in the Assistant Pane:**
   - "What's the status of this project?"
   - "Are there any blockers?"
   - "What should I work on next?"
   - "Which tasks are overdue?"
   - "What's our completion percentage?"

4. **Verify:**
   - ✅ Questions appear in activity feed
   - ✅ Answers appear below questions
   - ✅ Evidence can be expanded if provided
   - ✅ Questions and answers are linked in database
   - ✅ Usage is logged in ai_usage_logs table

### Database Verification:
Check the `proposals` table:
```sql
-- View recent Q&A
SELECT 
  id,
  activity_type,
  parent_id,
  rationale,
  evidence,
  created_at
FROM proposals
WHERE project_id = 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'
  AND activity_type IN ('question', 'answer')
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Files Modified

### AI Service (Python):
1. `ai-service/services/database_service.py` - Added 4 new methods
2. `ai-service/models.py` - Added QuestionRequest model
3. `ai-service/main.py` - Added /answer-question endpoint

### Backend (NestJS):
4. `backend/src/ai/ai.controller.ts` - Added answer-question route
5. `backend/src/ai/ai.service.ts` - Added answerQuestion method

### Frontend (React):
6. `frontend/src/types/database.types.ts` - Added Q&A types
7. `frontend/src/components/ai/AssistantPane.tsx` - Wired up chat input
8. `frontend/src/components/ai/ActivityCard.tsx` - Already had Q&A display

## Next Steps

Now that Q&A is hooked up with minimal guidance, you can:

1. **Test the AI's capabilities** - Ask various questions to see what it naturally understands
2. **Evaluate responses** - See if it needs more guidance or if it's already useful
3. **Add targeted prompts** - If needed, enhance the system prompt with specific instructions
4. **Implement proactive analysis** - Create scheduled jobs to analyze projects automatically
5. **Add specialized commands** - Create shortcuts like "/risks" or "/blockers" for common queries

## Success Criteria ✅

- ✅ User can ask questions via chat interface
- ✅ AI has access to all project data (tasks, dependencies, stats)
- ✅ Answers are generated and saved to database
- ✅ Q&A pairs are displayed in activity feed
- ✅ Questions and answers are properly linked
- ✅ Usage is tracked for cost monitoring
- ✅ Minimal prompt allows testing AI's natural capabilities
