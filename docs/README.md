## üìÅ Documentation Structure

### `/mvp/` - Current Implementation Focus
**What we're building RIGHT NOW through 5 incremental phases:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`MVP_SCOPE.md`](mvp/MVP_SCOPE.md) | Complete 5-phase roadmap |
| [`CURRENT_PHASE.md`](mvp/CURRENT_PHASE.md) | Active phase progress tracking |
| [`MVP_ARCHITECTURE.md`](mvp/MVP_ARCHITECTURE.md) | Simplified architecture for MVP |
| [`MVP_TO_FULL_MAP.md`](mvp/MVP_TO_FULL_MAP.md) | How MVP evolves to full platform |
| [`PHASE_1_GUIDE.md`](mvp/PHASE_1_GUIDE.md) | Detailed implementation guide for Phase 1 |

**Current Phase: Phase 1 - Foundation & Authentication**

### `/vision/` - Full Platform Design
**The complete vision that guides our MVP decisions:**

These documents describe the **final platform** we're building toward. They provide context for MVP decisions to ensure we don't build ourselves into corners.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`functional-spec.md`](vision/functional-spec.md) | Complete feature specifications |
| [`product-design.md`](vision/product-design.md) | User personas, journeys, magic moments |
| [`user-stories.md`](vision/user-stories.md) | All 42 user stories with acceptance criteria |
| [`system-architecture.md`](vision/system-architecture.md) | Full microservices architecture |
| [`data-architecture.md`](vision/data-architecture.md) | Complete database schema |

**Important**: We're NOT building all of this in the MVP. These documents ensure our MVP choices align with the ultimate vision.

### `/architecture/` - Technical Implementation
**Detailed implementation specs and decisions:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`TECH_DECISIONS.md`](architecture/TECH_DECISIONS.md) | Architecture decision log (ADRs) |
| [`api/openapi-specification.yaml`](architecture/api/openapi-specification.yaml) | API contracts |
| [`api/entities.ts`](architecture/api/entities.ts) | TypeScript type definitions |

### `/dev/` - Development Guides
**Day-to-day development resources:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`setup.md`](dev/setup.md) | Development environment setup |
| [`conventions.md`](dev/conventions.md) | Code style and conventions |
| [`testing.md`](dev/testing.md) | Testing practices |
