# Current Phase: Phase 1 - Foundation & Authentication

**Status**: 🔄 In Progress  
**Started**: 2025-10-06  
**Target Completion**: 2025-10-13 (1 week)  
**Owner**: Development Team

## 🎯 Phase 1 Goal

**Get users authenticated and show them an empty dashboard.**

Success = A user can:
1. Visit the app
2. Click "Sign in with Google" or "Sign in with Microsoft"
3. Complete OAuth flow
4. See a personalized dashboard (even if empty)
5. Logout and sign back in
6. Session persists across page refreshes

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before marking Phase 1 complete, verify:

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Can access login page at `/login`
- [ ] "Sign in with Google" redirects to Google OAuth
- [ ] After Google auth, redirected back to app
- [ ] See dashboard with my name/email displayed
- [ ] Can click logout and return to login page
- [ ] "Sign in with Microsoft" works the same way
- [ ] Refresh page → still logged in (session persists)
- [ ] Open in incognito → redirected to login (not authenticated)
- [ ] Protected routes redirect to login when not authenticated

### Database Testing
- [ ] User profile created in `user_profiles` table
- [ ] Organization created automatically for new user
- [ ] RLS policies prevent accessing other users' data

### Error Handling

## 📝 Notes

**Why Supabase?**
- Managed PostgreSQL - no database ops
- Built-in Auth - OAuth providers pre-integrated
- Real-time subscriptions - WebSocket automatic
- Row-Level Security - database-enforced permissions
- Fast local development - `supabase start` runs everything in Docker

**Why Phase 1 is Just Auth?**
- Validates the entire stack end-to-end
- Tests OAuth integration early (often tricky)
- Establishes development workflow
- Proves Supabase is working before adding complexity
- Small scope = quick win to build momentum
