# 🚨 Progress Bar Quick Fix

## TL;DR
The progress bar doesn't work because a database field is missing. Follow these 3 steps:

---

## ⚡ 3-Step Fix (2 minutes)

### 1️⃣ Open Supabase
Go to: https://supabase.com → Your Project → SQL Editor

### 2️⃣ Run This SQL
```sql
ALTER TABLE tasks 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS progress_percentage INTEGER DEFAULT 0 
CHECK (progress_percentage >= 0 AND progress_percentage <= 100);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS tasks_progress_percentage_idx ON tasks(progress_percentage);
```

### 3️⃣ Refresh Your App
Press F5 in your browser. Done! ✅

## 🎯 Visual Guide

### Where to Find SQL Editor in Supabase:
```
Dashboard → [Your Project] → SQL Editor (left sidebar) → New Query
```

### What to Paste:
Copy the SQL from Step 2 above, paste it into the editor, and click "Run"

### What You Should See:
```
Success. No rows returned
```
This is normal! It means the column was added successfully.

## 🔍 What Changed in the Code

I fixed several issues in the codebase:

1. **CSS Classes**: Changed `bg-primary-600` → `bg-primary` (+ fallback color)
2. **State Management**: Modal now uses `taskDetails` state for updates
3. **Data Sync**: Added useEffect to sync state when task updates
4. **Debug Info**: Added temporary debug output (can remove later)

The code is ready, just needs the database field!
